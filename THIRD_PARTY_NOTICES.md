The Xiaomi RC003 ATVV UUIDs, microphone command behavior, IMA/DVI ADPCM decoding order, capability parsing, and HID usage mapping were adapted from this project. The macOS implementation uses Apple public frameworks and does not include the upstream Windows injection, VB-CABLE packaging, commercial branding, or customer systems.

## BlackHole

- Project: `ExistentialAudio/BlackHole`
- Source: <https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole>
- Pinned source revision: `v0.7.1` / `e2b22aaaba4e507a097131704bf96dabc004d9cf`
- License: GNU General Public License v3.0 (`GPL-3.0`)

`scripts/build-driver.sh` applies `third_party/blackhole/blackhole-device-usb.patch` to the pinned source and builds a distinct `MiRemoteV2ch.driver`. The patch changes the Audio Device transport type to USB and assigns a separate CFPlugIn factory UUID. It does not modify an installed `BlackHole2ch.driver`.

## MiRemoteVoice

- Project: `VincentKingHsu/MiRemoteVoice`
- Source: <https://github.com/VincentKingHsu/MiRemoteVoice>
- Reference release: `v1.0.0-beta.1`
- Application license: MIT

The compatibility design is informed by MiRemoteVoice: a side-by-side BlackHole-derived device reports its actual audio device as USB transport so selected applications can enumerate it. This fork independently builds from pinned BlackHole source and does not reuse MiRemoteVoice binaries or replacement scripts.
